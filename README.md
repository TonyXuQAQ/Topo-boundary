# Topo-boundary
This is the official github repo of paper [Topo-boundary: A Benchmark Dataset on Topological Road-boundary Detection Using Aerial Images for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17119). 

[Project page](https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/Topo-boundary/).

[Supplementary document](./dataset/topoboundary_supplementary.pdf).

Topo-boundary is a publicly available benchmark dataset for topological road-boundary detection in aerial images. With an aerial image as the input, the evaluated method should predict the topological structure of road boundaries in the form of a graph.

This dataset is based on [NYC Planimetric Database](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md). Topo-boundary consists of 25,297 4-channel aerial images, and each aerial image has eight labels for different deep-learning tasks. More details about the dataset structure can be found in our paper. Follow the steps in the ```./dataset``` to prepare the dataset.

We also provide the implementation code (including training and inference) based on *PyTorch* of 9 methods. Go to the Implementation section for details.

## New models
You could try our latest proposed work [RNGDet++](https://github.com/TonyXuQAQ/RNGDetPlusPlus), which is much more powerful and flexible than iCurb.

## Update
* Oct/1/2021 Fix google drive link issue. The label and checkpoints should be able to be normally downloaded.
* Sep/17/2021 Add initial vertex prediction (under ```./graph_based_baselines/init_vertex```) and update the checkpoint of **OrientationRefine**.
* Aug/12/2021 Fix dataset download bug.
* Jul/2/2021 This paper is accepted and will appear on *The IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS​) 2021*.
* Jul/2/2021 The code of **ConvBoundary** has been cleaned and released.
* Jun/21/2021 This paper is accepted by *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters(RA-L)*.
* Jun/21/2021 The code of **DAGMapper** has been cleaned and released.
* May/27/2021 The code of **Enhanced-iCurb** has been cleaned and released.
* May/22/2021 *Topo_boundary* is released. More time is needed to prepare **ConvBoundary**, **DAGMapper** and **Enhanced-iCurb**, thus currently these models are not open-sourced.

## Platform information
Hardware info
```
GPU: one RTX3090 and one GTX1080Ti
CPU: i7-8700K
RAM: 32G
SSD: 256G + 1T
```

Software info
```
Ubuntu 18.04
CUDA 11.2
Docker 20.10.1
Nvidia-driver 460.73.01
```
Make sure you have Docker installed.

## Environment and Docker
Docker is used to set up the environment. If you are not familiar with Docker, refer to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Docker beginner tutorial](https://docker-curriculum.com/) for more information.

To build the Docker image, run:
```
# go to the directory
cd ./docker
# optional
chmod +x ./build_image.sh
# build the Docker image
./build_image.sh
```
The image is based on the Docker image ```pytorch/pytorch:1.7.0-cuda11.0-cudnn8-runtime``` provided on Docker hub. You may use other base image at [Pytorch_Docker_hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) based on your own preference.

To build Docker containers, check ```./build_container.bash``` under the directory of each baseline.

## Data and pretrain checkpoints preparation
Follow the steps in ```./dataset``` to prepare the dataset and checkpoints trained by us.

## Implementations 
We provide the implementation code of 9 methods, including 3 segmentation-based baseline models, 5 graph-based baseline models, and an improved method based on our previous work [iCurb](https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/iCurb/). All methods are implemented with *PyTorch* by ourselves. 

Note that the evaluation results of baselines may change after some modifications being made.

## Evaluation metrics
We evaluate our implementations by 3 relaxed-pixel-level metrics, the self-defined Entropy Connectivity Metric (ECM), naive connectivity metric (proposed in ConvBoundary) and Average Path Length Similarity ([APLS](https://medium.com/the-downlinq/spacenet-road-detection-and-routing-challenge-part-i-d4f59d55bfce)). For more details, refer to the [supplementary document](./dataset/topoboundary_supplementary.pdf).

## Related topics
Other research topics about line-shaped object detection could be inspiring to our task. **Line-shaped object** indicts target objects that have long but thin shapes, and the topology correctness of them also matters a lot. They usually have an irregular shape. E.g., road-network detection, road-lane detection, road-curb detection, line-segment detection, etc. The method to detect one line-shaped object could be adapted to another category without much modification.
